# SW Price Checker

## Summary
Now that Southwest has their prices listed on google flights this script allows you to scrape and compare prices to a manually set baseline. If the price drops you can either email or text yourself an alert so you can rebook at the lower price.

## Installation
Recommend installing pip to manage dependencies
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

This requires an App Password if using gmail which can be created [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
