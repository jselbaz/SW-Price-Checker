# SW Price Checker

## Summary
Now that Southwest has their prices listed on google flights this script allows you to scrape and compare prices to a manually set baseline. If the price drops you can either email or text yourself an alert so you can rebook at the lower price.

## Installation
Recommend installing pip to manage dependencies
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

This requires an App Password if using gmail which can be created [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

## Automation
I recommend making a cron job or scheduling a batch file to run this every few hours if using the local version

If using the containerized version you can schedule a lambda to run every few hours

## Container + Lambda + DDB + SSM Set Up
Upload image to ECR

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.dockerfile -t price-checker .

docker tag price-checker:latest AWS_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/price-checker:latest

docker push AWS_ACCOUNT.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/price-checker:latest
```

Create a new Lambda from the container image in this repo
Architecture: x86_64
Make sure to update the Lambda role so it has IAM permissions to read/write to DDB and read from SSM
Create a dynamoDB table to track price changes. Table's primary key should be an integer field called flight. Add an integer attribute field called price to the table as well.
Add RecipientCell, RecipientEmail, SenderEmail, and SenderEmailAppPassword as parameters in SSM.

Note that all shell scripts may need to be changed from CRLF to LF as Github changes them.

## Future Work
Add a front end
